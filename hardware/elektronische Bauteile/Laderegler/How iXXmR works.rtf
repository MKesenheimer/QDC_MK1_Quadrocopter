This brings the gate of the PMOS (G on the symbol) to ground and turns it on (i.e. opens the Source-Drain, marked S and D) allowing the battery to power the circuit. The Schottky (marked A and K) stops the battery raising the VUSB_IN line and turning the PMOS off again.\
when the adapter is plugged in, the gate is pulled to +5V and the PMOS turns off, leaving only the adapter voltage powering the circuit and letting the battery charge.}
